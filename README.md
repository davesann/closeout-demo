# closeout-demo

Simple noir webapp to deliver example Closeout clojurescript applications

In action here: http://closeout-demo.herokuapp.com/

If it's slow to start - it probably means that the instance has to boot up.


## If you want to build it

```
git clone https://github.com/davesann/closeout-demo.git
lein deps
lein run
```

note that the clojurescript is already compiled for this application.
This is beacuse it is easier to deploy this way.

If you want to build that, look here: https://github.com/davesann/closeout-demo-cljs
